# 👋 Hi, I'm Aladin

I'm on the journey to becoming a strong **Cloud Engineer**, focusing on building
solid fundamentals and real-world cloud projects rather than just theory.

I learn by designing, deploying and documenting AWS infrastructures from scratch,
with an emphasis on clean architecture, security and best practices.

## ☁️ Cloud Focus
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Networking & Security
- Infrastructure design & documentation
- Learning by doing

## 🧱 What I'm working on
- Designing AWS VPCs with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones
- Configuring Internet Gateways, route tables and secure traffic flow
- Deploying EC2 instances with controlled inbound and outbound access
- Building serverless components using AWS Lambda
- Working with Amazon DynamoDB for scalable NoSQL data storage
- Hosting static content using Amazon S3
- Applying security best practices with IAM roles and Security Groups
- Documenting cloud architectures clearly with diagrams and READMEs

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- AWS (VPC, EC2, IAM, Security Groups, S3, DynamoDB)
- Linux
- Git & GitHub
- Networking concepts (CIDR, routing, subnets)

## 🎯 Goal
Build a strong foundation to work professionally as a **Cloud / Junior Cloud Engineer**
and continuously improve through hands-on projects and learning.

## 📌 Philosophy
- Understand why a service is used over another
- Learn fundamentals before complexity
- Security and clarity over shortcuts
- Simple architectures done right
